# Tents and Trees puzzle with Python and Streamlit

This is a project to implement a "Tents and Trees" puzzle in Python.
The Tents (also known as "Tents and Trees") is a popular logic puzzle. 
According to https://wpcunofficial.miraheze.org/wiki/Tents, the puzzle was first published in 1989 by Léon Balmaekers under the name "Alen Verzamelen" in Dutch.
The rules of the puzzle are as follows:
•	Find all of the tents in the forest.
•	Every tent is attached to exactly one tree, and every tree is attached to exactly one tent.
•	The number of tents is the same as the number of trees.
•	The clues tell you how many tents are in that row or column.
•	A tent can only be found horizontally or vertically next to a tree.
•	Tents are never next to each other, neither vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
•	A tree might be next to two tents but is only connected to one.
